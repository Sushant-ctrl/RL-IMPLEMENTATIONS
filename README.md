# Reinforcement Learning Implementations

Hands on experience gives a clear understanding of the concepts read. Thus it is very important to implement all the algorithms read from books or research papers. It helps us gain a better insight on how to reproduce results.
The errors that we encounter int he process helps learn a lot of things which lectures and books don't teach!

This repository has all the implemetations of the algorithms I have read. I have used pytorch where ever a neural network was required one can use other tools as per their convinence.

Along with the implementations there are links to notes for  most of the algorithms. 

#### The Following algorithms are included:

- [x] Multiarmed Bandits
- [x] Tabular RL
- [x] Monte Carlo Methods
- [x] TD learning Methods
- [x] DQN
- [ ] Policy based Mehods
