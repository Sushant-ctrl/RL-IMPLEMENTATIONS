# Reinforcement Learning Implementations

###### tags: `Reinforcement Learning`

Hands on experience gives a clear understanding of the concepts read. Implementation gives a different and better view of the theoretical knowledge.
The errors that we encounter in the process helps learn a lot of things which lectures and books don't teach!

This repository has all the implementations of all the concepts and research papers read.

Each folder has a saperate Readme file where summary of the implemetations are given.

#### The Following algorithms are included:

- [x] Multiarmed Bandits
- [x] Tabular RL
- [x] Monte Carlo Methods
- [x] TD learning Methods
- [x] DQN* 
- [x] Policy based Mehods**


*There are variants to dqn algorithm which are implemented [here](https://github.com/Sushant-ctrl/DQN-Algorithms))

**There are so many policy gradient based algorithms which are implemented [here](https://github.com/Sushant-ctrl/PolicyGradient-Based-RL)
